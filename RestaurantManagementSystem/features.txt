 ============================= This restaurant management system has the following features: =========================================

- SQLite database holding all of the relevant data the application needs to function in a file 'RestaurantDB.sqlite'
- A login screen which verifies user access, i.e. whether they are regular staff, managers, or someone else who doesn't have
the relevant credentials and will therefore be prevented access to the system.
- The tables are depicted as circles which you can click on and to view the order (if the table has a current working order otherwise all the 
editable fields will be blank) or edit it.
- One click on a table allows you to view the order, a second click allows editing of the order.
- Orders can be categorised as current/working as in they are currently being served and can still be viewed by clicking tables, 
or orders are marked as complete and can be found as stored orders which can still be searched for in the search tab.
- Stored orders include completed orders saved from a table, or order imported by a manager.
- The time and date of an order is registered only when saving a new order only,so  when an order is updated by pressing save on an existing order
it does not replace the original time so you don't lose track of when the order was first made if you need to change something.
- You can edit/add food items comments, special requests, you can automatically calculate the total bill for items currently on the working order list
(not stored orders).
- You can mark the order as complete and then click save, at which point it will no longer be in the current orders, it will be in the stored orders,
 so you can still search for it but start registering a new order.
- You can search either stored or current orders by each individual field (table number, list of items ordered, price, date, time, comments, 
special requests, whether the order is complete) of the order and view the corresponding orders in a table.
- Accounts with manager level access can view both the staff screen and a special manager screen.
- In the manager screen you can add, remove or modify staff accounts, you can modify by simply adding new username
and password values to the a staffID value of the account you want to overwrite. 
- You can view activity logs for staff accounts which are tracked by the current user logged in. 
- You can edit the menus. 
- You can export a list of orders in CSV format to file with a name of your choice. 
- You can import a CSV file encoding a list of orders (each line representing an order, and the fields must be in the order that they are written 
in the tables, ant fields containing commas must be surrounded by speech marks). 
These orders are then displayed in a table on the import screen. You can then press save to store these orders into the stored orders table of 
the database.
- A template for importing CSV files is included in the submission folder called csvTemplate.csv
- There is a test file to import also showing the format imported files need to adhere to.
- There is a fail safe in case someone deletes the .SQLite file, a special account with the username: 'admin' , and password: 'password'. 
The CREATE IF NOT EXISTS queries are executed and a special account inserted every time the application is launched so there 
is always a way back in even if all the tables and data are lost. You can then insert accounts and menu 
items as you need quickly to get things running again
